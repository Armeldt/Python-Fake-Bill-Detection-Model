## Detailed Project Description:

For the last project of my data analysis training, I worked as a consultant for the National Organization for Counterfeit Money Control (ONCFM). The objective was to develop a Python-based model capable of identifying counterfeit euro bills by analyzing specific dimensions and features of the bills.

### Key Tasks and Objectives:

1. Data Preprocessing and Analysis:

    - Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing or erroneous values, using linear regression to impute missing data.
      
    - Perform exploratory data analysis with Python to identify key features for modeling and understand the dataset.

2. Predictive Modeling:

    - Experiment with various machine learning models in Python, including logistic regression and k-means, to build a model capable of detecting counterfeit bills.
      
    - Test and evaluate the models to select the most accurate algorithm for final deployment.

3. Model Evaluation and Tuning:

    - Fine-tune the chosen model and validate it using a test dataset to ensure robustness and accuracy.
      
    - Prepare the Python model for live testing, ensuring it can handle new, unseen data effectively.
  
    - Build an executable which encapsulate the trained model, enabling users to easily use it without needing to intercat with Python.

4. Reporting and Presentation:

    - Present the complete process, including data treatments, algorithms explored, and final model selection, to the ONCFM project lead.
      
    - Demonstrate the modelâ€™s performance using a new dataset provided during the presentation.

This project allowed me to apply my Python skills to predictive modeling and data processing, successfully creating a model to detect counterfeit bills.
